This project is a Python-based task management system for a small business, enabling user authentication and task tracking through two text files: user.txt (for login credentials) and tasks.txt (for task details). Users must log in with valid credentials and can then perform various actions, including registering new users, adding tasks, viewing all tasks, and viewing their own assigned tasks. New tasks include details such as the assigned user, title, description, due date, and completion status (defaulting to "No"). The system ensures secure access and efficient task organization for the team.
